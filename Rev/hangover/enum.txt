Meet Bajtek, the coding virtuoso at Gdańsk University of Technology. After a wild night of celebrating a successful compile, fueled by too much caffene (and probably something stronger) Bajtek awoke with a colossal hangover. The room echoed with the triumphant cheers of his algorithms from the night before, but there was one tiny hiccup—he couldn't remember his password.

As Bajtek squinted at the screen, even the gentle hum of his computer seemed as loud as a rock concert. With a head pounding like a runaway while loop, he asked you for help.
