In the last programming session, Bajtek unleashed a coding catastrophe â€“ his spaghetti code was so messy that even the compiler threw up its hands in surrender. Colleagues attempted to debug it, but the code was like a Rubik's Cube on a caffeine overdose. Bajtek proudly declared it an avant-garde programming masterpiece, leaving his coworkers wondering if they should call a programmer's version of an exorcist. In the end, they renamed his file spaghetti.cpp to noodleNightmare.cpp as a memorial to the chaotic session.
