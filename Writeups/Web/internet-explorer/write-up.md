The goal of the challenge is to visit the website using Internet Explorer and Linux. There is no way to run that browser on Linux, however we can just change the user-agent that is sent to the website and set OS as Linux and browser as Internet Explorer.
You can set it manually in Chrome/Firefox dev tools. An example of user-agent that will work: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko
